This is a program that simulates the behavior of round particles with mass and charge.

To start to see what it is capable of, open the program, click the "Proton" button, and place two pinky particles on black screen.
Then click an "Electron" button and push the new blue particle like you would push a bird towards a glass tower with green pigs ;).
